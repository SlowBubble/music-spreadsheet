# Goal

- Build a spreadsheet editor inside a textarea HTML element.
- It should be a UI component that another more complex editor can use

# TODO

- handle Tab by moving to the cell to the right
  - create a new cell if not already present
  - TODO think about how to overwrite this if we only want 4 cells per row.
- handle Enter by moving to the cell below

# Done

- handle input key normally
